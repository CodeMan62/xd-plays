# PlayZone – Snake MVP (Next.js)

This is a small Next.js app for a web arcade.  
For now it has a single playable game: **Snake**. Flappy Bird and a multiplayer football-style arena game are planned for later.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.  
   - The home page lists **Snake** as the first game.  
   - Scroll down or click the buttons to go to the Snake section and play.

## Controls

- Arrow keys or **WASD** to move.
- Eat food to grow and increase your score.
- Avoid walls and your own tail.
- Press **Start Game** or the **space bar** to restart.
